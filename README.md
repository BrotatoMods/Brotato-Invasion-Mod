# Brotato - Invasion Mod

**Invasion** ports items from Blobfish's previous game, Space Gladiators, to Brotato.

The latest updates and progress info will be posted on the [Space Potatoes Discord](https://discord.gg/j39jE6k).

## Install

Invasion uses dami's multi mod support script. This means it's distributed as a simple, small ZIP containing only the modded items, rather than than a full replacement PCK file.

To use it, set up a Brotato.pck file that's using dami's script. ATOW there are two pre-compiled builds available in these mods:

- [DebugLoader](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/Brotato-DebugLoader/releases) (wiki page [here](https://brotato.wiki.spellsandguns.com/Mod:DebugLoader))
- [dami's Arsenal](https://brotato.wiki.spellsandguns.com/Mod:Dami%27s_Arsenal)

One that's set up, add a fodler named *mods* to the Brotato game folder, and drop this mod's ZIP into *mods*.
