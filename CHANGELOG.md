## 0.4.0-alpha (Critters)

- Introduces **critters**: Sacrifice a bit of Harvesting to plant them in the ground, and they'll reward you with bonus stats at the end of each wave.
- New Items: Critters (4): *Aggressive Critter, Drugged Critter, Explosive Critter, Rich Critter*
- New Items: General (11): *Energy Armor, Lost Potato, Nanobug, Pet Food, Voodoo Totem, Barrel, Fruit Bag, Remote Detonator, Coral, Cursed Octopus, Ammo Box*
- Item balancing (see below)

- Big buffs for the current 3 weapons

### New Items

#### Critters (4)

- Aggressive Critter (atk speed)
- Drugged Critter (speed)
- Explosive Critter (explosion size)
- Rich Critter (double materials chance)

#### General (11)

- Energy Armor (+atk spd per armor)
- Lost Potato (+knockback, -%dmg)
- Nanobug (+explosion size per Ranged dmg)
- Pet Food (+damage per structure)
- Voodoo Totem (+ranged/melee when moving/not moving)
- Barrel (-enemy speed, +enemies)
- Fruit Bag (+max hp, +consumable healing, -lifesteal)
- Remote Detonator (small chance for enemies to explode, scales with Engineering, huge radius)
- Coral (sets a random negative stat to half its value, eg. -20 becomes -10)
- Cursed Octopus (+range per different weapon)
- Ammo Box (shops' only sell tier 2 weapons and above)

### Item Balancing

- All Shields: Now uncommon
- Alien Hat: Reworked, now gives +atk spd p/sec but costs -armor p/sec (probably OP!)
- Disgusting: Now uncommon, so you can tailor your build around it sooner.
- Banana Leaf: Changed to give %Dodge at the end of each wave, now uncommon
- Lava Balls: Elemental +4 > +3, Max HP -3 > -2
- Devil Armor: Attack speed per -1 Armor: +3% > +10% (massive buff!)
- Full Moon: Damage +5% > +8%
- Hairy Foot: -20 Range > -6% Speed

Thanks to ChristmassyJune for these suggestions too: (shown in *italics*)

- *Tier: Lotus (could be better being uncommon)* - Common in v0.3
- *Tier: Small Hand (could be better being common)* - Uncommon in v0.3; +15% feels like a lot as vanilla blues only give +10%
- *Tier: Bloody Tooth (should be common)* - keeping, as +5 melee feels like a lot for only -1 MaxHP
- *Weak: Blobfish* - Keeping, as the only other vanilla common +Dodge also reduces melee/ranged, so this is an alternative with a pretty small downside
- *Weak: Turtle* - Reduced speed penalty to -1%
- *Weak: Banana leaf* - Reworked, now uncommon and gives dodge every wave
- *Weak: Horn* - Buffed to +3 melee and -6 range
- *Weak: Waffle* - +MaxHP increased to +3, damage penalty reduced to -1%
- *Weak: Magnificent Egg* - Major buffs
- *Weak: Horse Shoe* - Increased speed to +4%, reduced -Lifesteal to -1%
- *Weak: Full Moon* - Increased +damage to +8
- *OP: Vampirism* - Uncommon in 0.3
- *OP: Blood drop* - Reduced Lifesteal to +2% (feels too weak now as it's the only grey Lifesteal item in Invasion and -1 MaxHP is pretty steep early game, but I'll use this for now)
- *OP: Metal Scrapper* - Reworked in 0.4, now gives +Armor each wave (Uncommon but farily expensive)
- *OP: Necklace* - Removed +Ranged, reduced -Atk speed to -2%
- *OP: Pocket Magician* - Removed +Ranged, reduced Armor to -2
- *OP: Knowledge* - Fixed cost not matching its tier (was set to an Uncommon cost)
- *OP: Beard* - Reduced +Elemental to +4, reduced Armor to +1
- *OP: Blueprint* - Increased cost
- *OP: Surgical Bot (too much lifesteal)* - Was reworked in 0.3 to give HP Regen instead
- *OP: Red Laser* - Was reworked in 0.3
- *Cost: Brain (good but needs to be cheaper)* - That cost might have been from an older version, reduced cost anyway

### Weapon Balancing

- Nail Bat: Major buffs (cooldown, dmg, Lifesteal scaling)
- Big Hand: Increased scaling for Max HP
- Clone: Buffed scaling at higher tiers
